Dispute over Preah Vihear

****

**Review**

*Introduction*

This literature review examines the historical and political facets of the Preah Vihear dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, with particular attention to the roles of colonial-era cartography, post-WWII territorial claims and nationalist mobilization, and the adjudication of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Drawing on Saikia (2012), Deth (2014), Lee (2014), and Kwok (2023)—who offer partially diverging analyses—this review first explores how French colonial boundary-making laid the foundation for future conflict. It then considers how these ambiguities escalated into bilateral tensions during the decades following WWII and became central to nationalist politics in both countries. Finally, it examines the continued relevance of colonial maps and the legal dimension through Cambodia’s referral to the ICJ and concludes that the dispute—with ramifications continuing to influence Cambodian-Thai relations today—is not just about the temple itself but also about sovereignty and legitimacy in a postcolonial world.

*Colonial origins*

The origins of the Preah Vihear dispute fundamentally lie in French colonial boundary-making in the early 20th century, where cartographic ambiguities—deliberate or not—would lead to later escalation. Lee (2014) emphasizes the role of the two Franco-Siamese treaties of 1904 and 1907, which defined the watershed[^1] as the border but left much uncertainty around highland temples such as Preah Vihear. In the latter treaty, French surveyors produced multiple maps that placed the temple on the Cambodian side, a decision that Lee interprets as intentional and made to advance French interests in the region[^2]. Saikia (2012), however, complicates this account by noting that Thailand displayed relative acquiescence when these maps were produced; Kwok (2023) corroboratively notes that the ICJ, in 1962, determined that Thailand must have accepted those maps due to 50 years of no objection[^3]. Therefore, any boundary ambiguities were not initially contentious. Indeed, the disputed maps only gained political salience much later when they resurfaced as key evidence presented by both countries before the ICJ. Taken together, Lee and Saikia advance two distinct interpretations of causality; for Lee, the dispute originated entirely from French colonial intentionality through cartographic manipulation, whereas for Saikia, it arose from the post-WWII reactivation of boundaries that had initially been tolerated.

*Developing bilateral tensions*

After French colonial forces departed Cambodia, Thailand seized control over Preah Vihear in 1954[^4], escalating the dispute into a direct Cambodian-Thai conflict. Saikia (2012) highlights how Thai occupation was perceived by Cambodians as a national affront, provoking anti-Thai resentment that extended well beyond the border provinces. Furthermore, as Deth (2014) notes, the temple’s significance became further elevated as a symbol of Khmer heritage at a moment when Cambodia was trying to reestablish its sovereignty after decades of colonial rule. For Prince Sihanouk and other elites, Preah Vihear also served as a means of rallying mass support; likewise, opposition groups also used the dispute to criticize the government’s handling of it, which politicized the temple. Kwok (2023), meanwhile, situates these tensions within a broader political context, noting that Cambodian nation-building and Thailand’s determination to reconsolidate its influence over contested borderlands entrenched the dispute. Therefore, occupation and nationalism entrenched the dispute during the 1950s. 

*ICJ adjudication; limits of law*

The ICJ became the principal forum through which Cambodia sought to resolve the Preah Vihear dispute, yet its interventions display both the power and limits of international law. In 1962, aforementioned colonial mapping discrepancies acquired significant legal weight when the ICJ ruled that the temple belonged to Cambodia by rooting its judgment in the 1907 Franco-Siamese map.

Lee (2014) argues that by relying on such colonial cartography, the ICJ turned imperial-era manipulation into instruments of international law, an example that demonstrates just how closely legal authority remained tethered to the age-old legacies of empire. Saikia (2012), complementarily, highlights that Thailand’s earlier acquiescence to the map brought down their case—hence, the ICJ’s reasoning reflected both documentary evidence and patterns of state conduct.

However, as Deth (2014) shows, the ICJ’s decision reached far beyond the legal sphere, since Prince Sihanouk, as mentioned, had framed Cambodia’s victory as a nationalist triumph and broadcast the 1962 Court decision to consolidate the state’s legitimacy. The ICJ, therefore, unknowingly fed into nationalist mobilization rather than settling remaining tensions, particularly since Thailand has often disregarded the judgment. Kwok (2023) provides a contemporary perspective by noting that Preah Vihear’s UNESCO World Heritage designation in 2008 reignited hostilities and prompted Cambodia to return to the ICJ for clarification, which culminated in their 2013 judgment that reaffirmed Cambodian sovereignty over the temple. However, while the Court once again sided with Cambodia, Kwok stresses that it still could not “neutralize nationalist sensitivities”.

Fundamentally, these perspectives suggest that ICJ adjudication was foundational yet limited. Although the Court provided Cambodia with decisive legal victories, it was unable to resolve the deeper nationalist tensions that had sustained the dispute. More broadly, the dispute illustrates how international law—while certainly powerful in conferring legitimacy, is structurally constrained against nationalist forces.

*Conclusion*

Taken together, the literature demonstrates that the dispute is neither purely a legal nor territorial matter. Historical contingency, nationalist politics, and international law were all involved; each factor amplified the others. Whilst colonial maps were the underlying cause of the dispute, nationalist mobilization post-WWII intensified the conflict, and international adjudication by the ICJ offered legitimacy without resolving much Cambodian-Thai tensions.

While the four articles examined—and broader literature—provide important insights into the dispute, several questions still remain. First, how did nationalist mobilization around Preah Vihear differ between elites, opposition groups, and the broader population in the two nations? Second, did similar sites in the watershed region experience comparable politicization in the post-WWII years, or is Preah Vihear uniquely salient in this regard? Last, can legal adjudication ever fully address historical grievances, or does it primarily play a symbolic role? Investigating these issues can provide a more comprehensive insight into the Preah Vihear dispute, and related disagreements.

**Personal comments**\
I am decently proud of this piece for the fact that I managed to stay reasonably close (1,035) to the soft word count of 1,000. I think my analysis and integration of sources were fine, and my thematic approach was ultimately credited.
